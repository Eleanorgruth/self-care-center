# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth. Mantras are phrases that are meant to be repeated during mindfulness practices. This app helps users remind themselves of their inherent value, and gives them an affirmation or mantra to use for self care.

The Self Care Center randomly generates either an affirmation or a mantra based on the user's input. The message is displayed after the use clicks the `Receive Message` button. Once the message is displayed the user has the option to clear the message, which resets the page.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. Fork the `self-care-center` repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. In the terminal cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor to view the code, which consists of three files,  main.js, index.html, and styles.css
5. View the project in the browser by running `open index.html` in your terminal

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This is the second solo project of the Turing Front End Software Development program. It was assigned during the 3rd week of the program after an introduction to HTML and CSS. I was given given four days to complete the project.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals for this project include:
* Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
* Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
* Individualize your programming skill set

I wrote this code using Atom text-editor, and the Terminal to push commits to  GitHub.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

* Wins:
  - This was the first time I wrote HTML and CSS to match a comp provided. I feel like I was able to get my app very close to the comp and am proud of my attention to detail.
  - Making an error handling feature was a big win. I started with making a window alert and then made the decision to put my error message on the website itself because I liked the look of it and felt like the functionality was better. It felt great to make informed decisions about my application as the developer.
* Challenges:
 - In order to get the proper formatting I taught myself flexbox. This felt like a large challenge to overcome before diving into the project. I watched youtube videos and read documentation to try to gain a better understanding. Once I felt like I learned enough to use the flexbox I started testing it our in my project, and used the Dev Tools for trial and error.
